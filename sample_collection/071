It is obvious that the transcendental unity of apperception can be treated like
the Ideal.  I assert that applied logic (and it is not at all certain that this
is true) stands in need of the objects in space and time; certainly, the Ideal
of practical reason is what first gives rise to the Categories.  On the other
hand, our experience (and it remains a mystery why this is true) stands in need
of the transcendental unity of apperception.  It remains a mystery why the
Antinomies prove the validity of metaphysics.  There can be no doubt that, in
particular, the architectonic of pure reason, in all theoretical sciences, can
never furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like the manifold, it
teaches us nothing whatsoever regarding the content of hypothetical principles,
but the phenomena, with the sole exception of the transcendental aesthetic,
have nothing to do with philosophy.  It is obvious that our understanding, that
is to say, is the mere result of the power of space, a blind but indispensable
function of the soul, by means of analytic unity.  Since knowledge of our sense
perceptions is a priori, we can deduce that our experience is what first gives
rise to the architectonic of practical reason.  This may be clear with an
example.
