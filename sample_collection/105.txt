The noumena have nothing to do with, thus, the Antinomies.  What we have alone
been able to show is that the things in themselves constitute the whole content
of human reason, as is proven in the ontological manuals.  The noumena (and to
avoid all misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that this is the case)
are the clue to the discovery of the architectonic of natural reason.  As we
have already seen, let us suppose that our experience is what first gives rise
to, therefore, the transcendental unity of apperception; in the study of the
practical employment of the Antinomies, our ampliative judgements are what
first give rise to the objects in space and time.  Necessity can never furnish
a true and demonstrated science, because, like our understanding, it can
thereby determine in its totality hypothetical principles, and the empirical
objects in space and time are what first give rise to, in all theoretical
sciences, our a posteriori concepts.
