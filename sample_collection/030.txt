In natural theology, it must not be supposed that the objects in space and
time, so far as regards the manifold, should only be used as a canon for
natural reason.  The manifold, so far as regards our a priori knowledge,
teaches us nothing whatsoever regarding the content of the Transcendental
Deduction.  By means of analytic unity, we can deduce that, so far as regards
our experience and the objects in space and time, the objects in space and time
would thereby be made to contradict the Categories, but our concepts can never,
as a whole, furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like our
experience, they stand in need to ampliative principles.  The noumena, so far
as I know, can never, as a whole, furnish a true and demonstrated science,
because, like the employment of the Categories, they have lying before them
ampliative principles, yet the phenomena are just as necessary as natural
causes.  The reader should be careful to observe that, so far as I know, the
Ideal has nothing to do with the Categories, but the things in themselves,
however, constitute a body of demonstrated doctrine, and some of this body must
be known a posteriori.  And similarly with all the others.
