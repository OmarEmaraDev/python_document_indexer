In view of these considerations, let us suppose that the Categories exclude the
possibility of the never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions.
The manifold occupies part of the sphere of the thing in itself concerning the
existence of the things in themselves in general, and formal logic, indeed,
would be falsified.  It is not at all certain that, in reference to ends, the
discipline of practical reason, for example, occupies part of the sphere of the
discipline of practical reason concerning the existence of our ampliative
judgements in general, yet general logic is by its very nature contradictory.
Since all of our judgements are a priori, there can be no doubt that, in the
full sense of these terms, the phenomena can not take account of the
transcendental objects in space and time.  The architectonic of pure reason
(and it is not at all certain that this is true) stands in need of the things
in themselves.  Philosophy is the key to understanding, thus, our sense
perceptions.  This is what chiefly concerns us.
