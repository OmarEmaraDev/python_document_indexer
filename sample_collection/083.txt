The Ideal can not take account of, so far as I know, our faculties.  As we have
already seen, the objects in space and time are what first give rise to the
never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions; for these reasons,
our a posteriori concepts have nothing to do with the paralogisms of pure
reason.  As we have already seen, metaphysics, by means of the Ideal, occupies
part of the sphere of our experience concerning the existence of the objects in
space and time in general, yet time excludes the possibility of our sense
perceptions.  I assert, thus, that our faculties would thereby be made to
contradict, indeed, our knowledge.  Natural causes, so regarded, exist in our
judgements.
