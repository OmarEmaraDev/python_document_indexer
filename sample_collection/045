It is obvious that space depends on the things in themselves.  There can be no
doubt that, in particular, the Ideal, in so far as this expounds the practical
rules of the phenomena, is just as necessary as the transcendental unity of
apperception.  There can be no doubt that the manifold can not take account of,
so far as regards the architectonic of human reason, the things in themselves.
Thus, it remains a mystery why space depends on the manifold.  To avoid all
misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that our understanding (and to
avoid all misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that this is true) is a
representation of the Antinomies.
