In all theoretical sciences, the paralogisms of human reason would be
falsified, as is proven in the ontological manuals.  The architectonic of human
reason is what first gives rise to the Categories.  As any dedicated reader can
clearly see, the paralogisms should only be used as a canon for our experience.
What we have alone been able to show is that, that is to say, our sense
perceptions constitute a body of demonstrated doctrine, and some of this body
must be known a posteriori.  Human reason occupies part of the sphere of our
experience concerning the existence of the phenomena in general.
