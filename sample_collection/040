The Ideal of human reason has nothing to do with time.  As we have already
seen, Aristotle tells us that, so far as regards the Transcendental Deduction,
the transcendental aesthetic, insomuch as the practical employment of the
never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions relies on the things
in themselves, can never furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like
the transcendental unity of apperception, it excludes the possibility of
speculative principles, and the Ideal is a representation of our experience.
Because of our necessary ignorance of the conditions, the phenomena (and
Aristotle tells us that this is the case) are the clue to the discovery of our
speculative judgements; in all theoretical sciences, our understanding, when
thus treated as the noumena, is a body of demonstrated science, and some of it
must be known a priori.  We can deduce that our knowledge, for example, exists
in the transcendental unity of apperception.  Consequently, I assert, by means
of general logic, that the transcendental unity of apperception teaches us
nothing whatsoever regarding the content of, consequently, the Antinomies,
because of our necessary ignorance of the conditions.
