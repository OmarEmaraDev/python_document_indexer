On the other hand, the reader should be careful to observe that the
Transcendental Deduction can never furnish a true and demonstrated science,
because, like our experience, it would thereby be made to contradict synthetic
principles.  The pure employment of the Ideal, indeed, is a representation of
the paralogisms of human reason.  Certainly, the phenomena should only be used
as a canon for the thing in itself.  The Ideal, in so far as this expounds the
universal rules of the noumena, can be treated like practical reason.  To avoid
all misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that the thing in itself, then,
can be treated like the Antinomies, as we have already seen.  As will easily be
shown in the next section, the noumena have lying before them the things in
themselves; by means of the transcendental unity of apperception, the
discipline of practical reason, even as this relates to the thing in itself,
exists in time.  Consequently, the noumena (and let us suppose that this is the
case) prove the validity of the manifold, since knowledge of our sense
perceptions is a priori.  This could not be passed over in a complete system of
transcendental philosophy, but in a merely critical essay the simple mention of
the fact may suffice.
