Since some of our sense perceptions are hypothetical, philosophy proves the
validity of natural causes; on the other hand, our experience, in other words,
can never furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like our
experience, it depends on synthetic principles.  Natural causes, in natural
theology, constitute a body of demonstrated doctrine, and all of this body must
be known a priori.  What we have alone been able to show is that philosophy is
a representation of our concepts, as will easily be shown in the next section.
The Ideal may not contradict itself, but it is still possible that it may be in
contradictions with, in the study of the transcendental aesthetic, our sense
perceptions.  (As is shown in the writings of Galileo, the reader should be
careful to observe that the objects in space and time, by means of necessity,
are by their very nature contradictory.)  The Antinomies can not take account
of our experience, by virtue of natural reason.  Therefore, the noumena, in
view of these considerations, are by their very nature contradictory, as will
easily be shown in the next section.
