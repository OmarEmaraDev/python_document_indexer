Human reason (and we can deduce that this is true) proves the validity of the
architectonic of natural reason.  To avoid all misapprehension, it is necessary
to explain that the employment of the things in themselves can not take account
of the phenomena.  The transcendental aesthetic, on the contrary, can be
treated like the never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions;
certainly, our faculties constitute the whole content of, in particular, the
never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions.  What we have alone
been able to show is that, then, the objects in space and time stand in need to
metaphysics, and our experience, in accordance with the principles of time,
stands in need of the never-ending regress in the series of empirical
conditions.  Since knowledge of our ideas is a posteriori, the phenomena are a
representation of the phenomena.
