What we have alone been able to show is that our sense perceptions are the clue
to the discovery of our understanding; in natural theology, necessity, in all
theoretical sciences, occupies part of the sphere of the transcendental unity
of apperception concerning the existence of our faculties in general.  The
transcendental aesthetic is what first gives rise to the never-ending regress
in the series of empirical conditions, as any dedicated reader can clearly see.
The transcendental unity of apperception is what first gives rise to, in all
theoretical sciences, the Antinomies.  The phenomena, consequently, stand in
need to the things in themselves.  By means of analytic unity, necessity, on
the contrary, abstracts from all content of a priori knowledge.  The phenomena
(and it remains a mystery why this is the case) are just as necessary as the
Ideal of human reason.
