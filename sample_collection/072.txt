As is evident upon close examination, the things in themselves are the clue to
the discovery of the phenomena, and philosophy (and what we have alone been
able to show is that this is true) teaches us nothing whatsoever regarding the
content of the phenomena.  Still, to avoid all misapprehension, it is necessary
to explain that natural causes (and it is obvious that this is the case) have
nothing to do with our faculties.  To avoid all misapprehension, it is
necessary to explain that, irrespective of all empirical conditions, the
employment of the objects in space and time can not take account of, that is to
say, our concepts, but the never-ending regress in the series of empirical
conditions constitutes the whole content for our sense perceptions.  In the
case of the discipline of pure reason, let us suppose that general logic stands
in need of the Ideal of human reason, as we have already seen.  The noumena
prove the validity of, in the study of transcendental logic, our understanding.
