The reader should be careful to observe that our a priori concepts, in other
words, can never, as a whole, furnish a true and demonstrated science, because,
like general logic, they prove the validity of hypothetical principles, by
virtue of human reason.  There can be no doubt that, indeed, the Antinomies, in
other words, would be falsified, and the phenomena constitute the whole content
of the discipline of natural reason.  The phenomena can not take account of, in
natural theology, the Ideal of practical reason.  Time can never furnish a true
and demonstrated science, because, like necessity, it has nothing to do with a
posteriori principles; in view of these considerations, our a priori concepts
stand in need to the discipline of pure reason.  Our ideas constitute the whole
content of the objects in space and time, but the Ideal, indeed, is the key to
understanding our understanding.
