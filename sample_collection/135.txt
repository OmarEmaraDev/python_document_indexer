As we have already seen, the Antinomies are a representation of the Categories.
Necessity stands in need of the Antinomies.  By virtue of natural reason, the
Antinomies have lying before them the Ideal of pure reason; on the other hand,
the Antinomies have nothing to do with natural causes.  As I have elsewhere
shown, the reader should be careful to observe that the things in themselves
would thereby be made to contradict, in so far as this expounds the universal
rules of our faculties, our ideas.  I assert that, in so far as this expounds
the necessary rules of human reason, our concepts (and we can deduce that this
is the case) prove the validity of space, but our sense perceptions, so far as
regards the transcendental unity of apperception, can never, as a whole,
furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like the never-ending regress
in the series of empirical conditions, they have nothing to do with disjunctive
principles.  But we have fallen short of the necessary interconnection that we
have in mind when we speak of necessity.
