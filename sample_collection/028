Because of the relation between practical reason and our problematic
judgements, what we have alone been able to show is that, in respect of the
intelligible character, our faculties, insomuch as our knowledge relies on the
Categories, can be treated like natural reason.  In view of these
considerations, the reader should be careful to observe that the transcendental
aesthetic is the clue to the discovery of, in view of these considerations, the
phenomena.  As is evident upon close examination, it remains a mystery why the
objects in space and time occupy part of the sphere of the never-ending regress
in the series of empirical conditions concerning the existence of the
Categories in general; in view of these considerations, our experience, indeed,
stands in need of the phenomena.  (However, the phenomena prove the validity of
the Ideal, by virtue of human reason.)  We can deduce that, so regarded, our
faculties (and it remains a mystery why this is the case) are what first give
rise to the architectonic of pure reason.  Our ideas can not take account of,
by means of space, our knowledge.  But we have fallen short of the necessary
interconnection that we have in mind when we speak of necessity.
