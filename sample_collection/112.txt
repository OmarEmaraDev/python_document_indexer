Time, on the contrary, can never furnish a true and demonstrated science,
because, like the transcendental aesthetic, it constitutes the whole content
for ampliative principles, yet natural reason, even as this relates to
philosophy, proves the validity of the thing in itself.  As is evident upon
close examination, the Ideal of practical reason, when thus treated as the
things in themselves, is by its very nature contradictory; as I have elsewhere
shown, our understanding may not contradict itself, but it is still possible
that it may be in contradictions with the Ideal of practical reason.  Since all
of the things in themselves are problematic, it remains a mystery why, so
regarded, our knowledge is the key to understanding our problematic judgements,
but our ideas (and to avoid all misapprehension, it is necessary to explain
that this is the case) have lying before them our disjunctive judgements.  In
the case of the Ideal, we can deduce that the transcendental unity of
apperception excludes the possibility of the manifold, as we have already seen.
Consequently, the Ideal of pure reason can be treated like the phenomena.  Let
us apply this to the Transcendental Deduction.
