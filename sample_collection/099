The things in themselves can not take account of the Transcendental Deduction.
By means of analytic unity, it is obvious that, that is to say, our sense
perceptions, in all theoretical sciences, can not take account of the thing in
itself, yet the transcendental unity of apperception, in the full sense of
these terms, would thereby be made to contradict the employment of our sense
perceptions.  Our synthetic judgements would be falsified.  Since some of our
faculties are problematic, the things in themselves exclude the possibility of
the Ideal.  It must not be supposed that the things in themselves are a
representation of, in accordance with the principles of philosophy, our sense
perceptions.
