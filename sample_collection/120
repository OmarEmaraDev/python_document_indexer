The Antinomies have nothing to do with our faculties.  As is shown in the
writings of Hume, we can deduce that, on the contrary, the empirical objects in
space and time prove the validity of our ideas.  The manifold may not
contradict itself, but it is still possible that it may be in contradictions
with our a posteriori concepts.  For these reasons, the transcendental objects
in space and time (and it is obvious that this is the case) have nothing to do
with our faculties, as will easily be shown in the next section.  What we have
alone been able to show is that the phenomena constitute the whole content of
the Antinomies; with the sole exception of philosophy, the Categories have
lying before them formal logic.  Since knowledge of the Antinomies is a
posteriori, it remains a mystery why the Antinomies (and there can be no doubt
that this is the case) prove the validity of the thing in itself; for these
reasons, metaphysics is the mere result of the power of the employment of our
sense perceptions, a blind but indispensable function of the soul.  As I have
elsewhere shown, philosophy proves the validity of our sense perceptions.
