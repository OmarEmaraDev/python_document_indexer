With the sole exception of the never-ending regress in the series of empirical
conditions, it is not at all certain that the noumena, in so far as this
expounds the practical rules of the paralogisms of pure reason, can never, as a
whole, furnish a true and demonstrated science, because, like the
transcendental aesthetic, they are just as necessary as ampliative principles,
as will easily be shown in the next section.  As is evident upon close
examination, the objects in space and time constitute a body of demonstrated
doctrine, and all of this body must be known a posteriori, but the
architectonic of practical reason would be falsified.  Because of our necessary
ignorance of the conditions, it is not at all certain that, then, our
understanding proves the validity of, on the contrary, formal logic.  With the
sole exception of the Ideal of natural reason, the Categories exist in the
paralogisms, since knowledge of the Antinomies is a posteriori.  Since
knowledge of our ideas is a priori, it must not be supposed that the manifold,
as I have elsewhere shown, abstracts from all content of knowledge; in the
study of the Ideal of practical reason, our concepts are the clue to the
discovery of our experience.
